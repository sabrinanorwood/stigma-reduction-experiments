# Stigma reduction experiments

These studies were completed as part of my PhD. They explore whether perspective taking interventions can reduce stigma toward LGBTQ+ people.

This public repository shares the code for analysis and visualization, but not the raw data due to ethics/privacy constraints. Code is shared both for reproducibility reasons and to showcase my R skills!

No study 1 (chapter 2 in thesis) as this was done in SPSS early in my PhD before I learned R, and chapter 1 was lit review.
